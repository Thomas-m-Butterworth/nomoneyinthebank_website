        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            Otherwise known as Thom Bee & Andrew Marsh, (No) Money in the Bank are an alternative comedy double-act, 
            comedians, best friends, and absolute weirdos. The pair bonded at a show over their mutual love of wrestling,
            pop-punk and 90s sitcoms, and now all they do is create shows that reflect these mutual loves.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thom & Andrew have written and performed two one-hour long shows together for Edinburgh Fringe. 2018’s ‘(No) Money in the Bank’, and 2019’s ‘Nobody Likes You When You’re 33’. A wrestling themed and pop-punk themed show respectively. The duo took their first show on the road with a rip-roaring self-funded tour across the UK, playing at several comedy festivals across the UK,
            including those in Glasgow, Leicester, and Brighton. They recently performed their hour show together, "National Chocolate Wafer Day" at Brighton Fringe 2021.
            They're also working on their own solo shows.
        </p>
        <p>
            (No) Money in the Bank have performed all over the UK for a variety of nights, usually opting for the more community led,
            alternative spaces like ACID comedy in Leeds, or Blizzard, Manchester. 
            They take pride in being able to give any room a momentous experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thom & Andrew also run their own alternative comedy night ‘Valhalla of Decadence’ in Leeds, as well as being closely associated with a lot of the North’s alternative comedy scene.
            During the pandemic, they have been focussing their attention on the weekly, online talk-show ‘Social Distance Warriors’, with Blizzard Comedy’s Kirstie Summers,
            which combines interviews with bands, comedians, and artists with madcap games.
        </p>
        <p>
            (No) Money in the Bank are the closest thing to a punk band’s mentality in the world of stand-up comedy.
            They always bring that DIY ethic and chaotic stage presence to every performance they put on.

            <h2>Thom Bee</h2>
            <p>
            Thom started out as circus performer, and after double knee surgery decided to beg for your love using a
            microphone instead. Thom has performed all around the UK, as well as Berlin,
            and can usually be found doing stand-up or compering circus events.<br><br>

            Nerdy, pop-culture heavy material and generally just very cheerful, but also deeply
            sad. Thom's basically ska music in human form.<br><br>

            Between planning ridiculous tour schemes, posing with his cats, and co-hosting <em>Social Distance Warriors</em>, Thom is also working on his debut solo show <em>Psychocinematic</em!></p>

        <h2>Andrew Marsh</h2>
        <p>One of the many great weirdos of the Leeds and Manchester comedy scene,
        Andrew is an absolute delight to watch.<br><br>

        Usually seen drinking wine, spouting nonsensical poetry, quoting pop-punk or watching
        Friends whilst doing all of the above. Andrew is also the mastermind behind our
        current blast of Drive-Thru Records recaps and Apple Shampoo comics,
        which were started before this madcap outfit began and we’re just choosing to continue.<br><br>

        Also working on his first solo show, Andrew is busy hammering away at previews for
            <em>Balthazar Dark Presents: Wrestling with Saddos</em>.
